/*
Problem: Sort an Array of 0s, 1s, and 2s

Given an array containing only `0s`, `1s`, and `2s`, sort the array in a way that all `0s` are placed at the beginning, followed by all `1s`, and all `2s` at the end. Do this in a single pass through the array and without using any built-in sorting functions.

Input:
- An array `arr` of size `n` where each element is either `0`, `1`, or `2`.

Output:
- The sorted array.

Example 1:
Input: arr = [0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2]
Output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]

Example 2:
Input: arr = [2, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2]
Output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]

Example 3:
Input: arr = [1, 0, 2]
Output: [0, 1, 2]

Constraints:
- The array contains only `0s`, `1s`, and `2s`.
- The array size is `n` where 1 <= n <= 1000.
